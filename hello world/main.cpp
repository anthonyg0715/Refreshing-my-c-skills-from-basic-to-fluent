#include <iostream>//preprocessor directive which gives instructions to the compiler to process the information before
//actual compilation starts

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;//basic output stream "<<" <-- these are called insertion operators
    return 0;//when the compiler reaches this line it just means that everything else is fine
}
